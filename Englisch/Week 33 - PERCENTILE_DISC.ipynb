                "Like the `CUME_DIST` function introduced last week, `PERCENTILE_DISC` is a statistical function. It was introduced in SQL Server 2012 and calculates quantiles. If you want to use the 0.5-quantile of a set (or 'sample' if we want to stick to the usual terminology used in statistics) you understand the value where half of all values are smaller and the other half are larger than this value. Accordingly, the 0.1-quantile is the value where 10% of the values are smaller and 90% of the values are larger than it. You can calculate quantiles with `PERCENTILE_DISC`. As with `CUME_DIST`, a window with sorting is specified and the value of the `ORDER BY` columns is returned, where the distribution function, i.e. `CUME_DIST` in the same window is greater than the passed value for the first time.  \r\n",
