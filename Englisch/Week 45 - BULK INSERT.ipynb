If you want to do this for a SQL database in the cloud, you don't have an SSIS engine available for the time being, you need to use an Azure Data Factory with an Integration Services Runtime. But if it's just a matter of loading a formatted file into a table, you may be able to take a slightly \"easier\" way and load the data into the table using a `BULK INSERT` statement. \r\n",

To have data that we can import, we export the data from a query on the `WideWorldImporters` database to a CSV file. To do this, we execute the following query in Azure Data Studio:"
