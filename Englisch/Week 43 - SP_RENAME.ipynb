Using `SP_RENAME` is quite easy, but be careful, if you run the following examples you can destroy your databases permanently, so as always in the Dojo, please use a non-critical game database, where it doesn't matter if one or the other view doesn't work anymore. We use the WideWorldImporters database in the Docker container. The simplest call is to rename the WideWorldImporters database first:"

So when it comes to refactoring, the `SP_RENAME` procedure is a welcome tool, and it does quite a bit of the work in many places to ensure that your renaming does not at least leave you in a state where your database is fundamentally flawed (foreign keys that run out of space, threatening the referential integrity of the database). However, even `SP_RENAME` cannot do everything: you still have to take care of the correctness of your applications, views, scripts and procedures after renaming. So be careful when renaming! \n",
