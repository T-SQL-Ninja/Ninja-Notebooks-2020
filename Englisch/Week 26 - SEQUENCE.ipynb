                "One of the most important `SEQUENCE`s we already introduced to you in the last Randori. In general, a `SEQUENCE` object is a generalization of the `IDENTITY` attribute. While the `IDENTITY` attribute ensures that every new row is assigned a new number, the `SEQUENCE` object is an object that creates rows of numbers. Unlike the `IDENTITY` attribute, it is not bound to another database object (i.e. a table), but is a separate object that can be queried and used. \r\n",
