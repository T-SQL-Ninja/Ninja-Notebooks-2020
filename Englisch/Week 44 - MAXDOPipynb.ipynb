                "You've probably noticed when viewing execution plans in SQL Server that there are often two small arrows on a yellow background (in SQL Server Management Studio) and the operation \"Parallelism (Gather Streams)\". What this means, simply put, is that at some points SQL Server decides to execute certain operations in parallel in multiple threads. You can control how many processors SQL Server can use for this by using the `MAXDOP` query hint. `MAXDOP` stands for \"Max Degree Of Parallelism\". \r\n",
                "## How can you set the MAXDOP?\r\n",
                "The `MAXDOP` is a query hint, and as with all query hints, be careful here, as you are overriding the behavior that either the relational database engine developers or your database administrator have provided. And if you do so, you should at least have a good reason for doing so. \r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "So much for the warning, but now for setting the `MAXDOP`. In general, there are fixed values for `MAXDOP` for the server or database during setup, these can be quite different, but the value for the database will then overwrite the value for the server. Both values can be overwritten by the query. To do this, add an `OPTION (MAXDOP x)` with an integer value x at the end of your query. Special features include the value 0, which explicitly tells the query to use as many cores as available, and the value 1, which tells the query to use only one core, thus explicitly disabling parallelization. \r\n",
                "\r\n",

Overall, of course, this increases CPU costs, as parallelization causes overhead, but overall, execution time often decreases as these higher costs are processed in multiple threads simultaneously. As mentioned at the beginning, you should be careful when using such hints, because usually both the SQL Server developers and the system administrators have thought of something when setting the parameters, but you have the possibility to make especially resource-hungry queries that require many CPU operations and run at times when other processes are also active on the server a bit more \"friendly\" by preventing them from blocking all processor cores that are available. Or make them run as fast as possible by grabbing all resources that are available. The choice is yours. \n",
