                "Basically SQL Server allows you to create temporary objects that you can work with. This is convenient because you don't necessarily want to persist every intermediate result or help table in your database when working with large amounts of data. Temporary means that the tables are stored in the `tempdb` and are automatically deleted. When they are deleted varies, so we will take a closer look at that in a moment. But there is not only the possibility to create tables temporarily, this also works with procedures.  \r\n",
                "## How can you work with temporary objects?\r\n",
                "There are basically two types of temporary objects in SQL Server: local and global temporary objects. You can recognize temporary objects by the fact that their names begin with a hash (#). You can tell whether an object is local or global by whether it has one or two hash marks in front of it. Let's look at the differences between the two objects. First, we will create a local temporary table:\r\n",
