                "The last time you worked in the Dojo you used the `PERCENTILE_DISC` function. This function always returned you the exact value in your table where a certain quantile was reached. That is, it operated on the discrete set of data and picked a specific value from that set, but what if you wanted to have an interpolated quantile instead, one that works on a continuous distribution function, i.e. one that doesn't work with discrete values like number or day but with continuous values? This is what the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function does, which will be your Randori partner today. \r\n",

                "Like last week, today's dojo will be rather short, as the syntax is not surprisingly the same as for `PERCENTILE_DISC`. So let's take a data set where we can compare both functions. \r\n",
