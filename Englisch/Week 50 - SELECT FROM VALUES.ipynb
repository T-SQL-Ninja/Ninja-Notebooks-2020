The disadvantage of this is that if you want to run your script multiple times, you always had to drop these objects with a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`, which doesn't really increase the readability. And even if you want to join against a small table in an application, which you don't want to persist in the database or create as a temporary object in the TempDB, `SELECT FROM VALUES` is an alternative to the popular #-tables. \r\n",

It's simple: your code will be easier if you don't have to clear the objects yourself and can simply run queries multiple times in the same context without worrying about duplicates. Also, you don't need to write `CREATE` statements, you can simply create and use the objects directly in the query. \n",
