Because `REPLACE` always searches the entire search string and tries to replace it. So if the second argument is contained entirely in the first argument, it is replaced by the third argument. With `TRANSLATE`, on the other hand, the search and replacement is character by character, so in the example, every \"u\" is replaced by an \"o\" and every \"k\" by a \"j\". This also explains why we got an error in the previous example, because if we replace 1:1, we need a replacement for every character, of course.
