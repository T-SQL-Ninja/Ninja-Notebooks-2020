The `DATEDIFF` function belongs to the functions for time objects, with it you can calculate the time between two datetime timestamps. You are free to specify the interval in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds or nanoseconds, only the return value must be in the value range of `INT`. \r\n",
