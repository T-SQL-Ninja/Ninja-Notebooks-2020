                "Suppose you have a table with certain values and you want to know what percentage of records are below each value. This kind of question can be answered by the `CUME_DIST` function. `CUME_DIST` is short for \"Cumulative Distribution\" and is a statistical function that calculates for a given value and distribution the probability of a record being below the value. \r\n",

                "So now that we have clarified what `CUME_DIST` does, let's take a look at how you can use the function. It is clear that we are dealing with distributions in `CUME_DIST`, so the function will return a floating point number between 0 and 1. \r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "To get some experience with `CUME_DIST`, we will first write a query that matches the `StockItems` of the `WideWorldImporters` database with their item groups. Since there are items that are assigned to several item groups, we do not use a join for this, but always assign these items to the first group: "
