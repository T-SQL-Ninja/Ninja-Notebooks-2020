In the case of `COALESCE` the 2.00, which is passed to the function but has a higher accuracy than the NinjaSkillLevel column, so here the SQL Server decides to convert the `NinjaSkillLevel` to the datatype of 2.00, i.e. to do an implicit conversion. Thus we divide 5 by a floating-point number, which results in a floating-point number, so here we get the correct value of 2.5 (with some trailing zeros).

Another advantage is that it is also possible to return a `NULL` value if all columns contain `NULL` values. A side effect of this fact is that if you define a derived column with `ISNULL`, that column can be used as the primary key, because `ISNULL` cannot be NULL and the return value is eligible for SQL Server as the primary key. It's different with `COALESCE`, the return value here could theoretically be `NULL`, although you can effectively prevent this with a constant value as the last argument.
