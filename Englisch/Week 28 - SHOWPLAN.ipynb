One warning first: reading execution plans is a science in itself and there are many who have devoted themselves to this science with great dedication and who can do it much better than your Shogun here (we bow our heads in awe towards the great Ricken-San). So don't expect great insights here, but rather an overview of what is available. So to speak the entrance of the rabbit hole. \r\n",
